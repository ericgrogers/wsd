			<p class="testimony_paragraph">“TGS, I can’t thank you enough for all of the sound advice you gave me concerning my acoustic guitar. 
			I thought for sure that my guitar was never going to be playable again after lying in the floodwaters, 
			but you proved me wrong! All of your instructions were very clear and easy to follow. 
			Any time I had a problem, your staff was quick to assist me in making the right decisions. 
			Since I’ve started following your 12-point guitar care checklist, I’ve fallen in love with my guitar 
			all over again. Thanks a million! I owe it all to you.</p>

			woods to make the guitar stunning visually, and sonically. No matter if you play acoustic or electric, we can help 
			you keep your guitar in the best shape possible.</p>

			No matter the condition of your instrument now, we’ll help you make it <em class="emphasis">better</em>!
			We provide everything you need to care for your guitars, from “tips and tricks” that every touring musician should know, to sound advice that the even the bedroom guitarist can use.
			If at any time you feel that your guitar could use professional service, we can assist you in locating the nearest reputable technician.</p>
		
			<p class="about_p3">We will teach your how to change your strings, and prolong their life to keep your instrument sounding the way it should. 
			We will also teach you when and how to clean your guitar properly, prolonging the life of the finish and fret board. Once you 
			have the basics under control, we’ll also show you some “what not to do” situations that you may be overlooking, and how to store 
			your guitar properly when you won’t be playing it for a while.</p>
