				<p>“TGS, I can’t thank you enough for all of the sound advice you gave me concerning my acoustic guitar. 
				I thought for sure that my guitar was never going to be playable again after lying in the floodwaters, 
				but you proved me wrong! All of your instructions were very clear and easy to follow. 
				Any time I had a problem, your staff was quick to assist me in making the right decisions. 
				Since I’ve started following your 12-point guitar care checklist, I’ve fallen in love with my guitar 
				all over again. Thanks a million! I owe it all to you.</p>
